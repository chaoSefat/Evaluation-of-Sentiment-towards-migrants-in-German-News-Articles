## 🧠 Overview

This project investigates how sentiment toward *refugees*, *asylum seekers*, and *immigrants* has changed over time in **English** and **German** news media, using sentence-level analysis powered by **GPT-4-mini**.

Using the **Leipzig Corpora Collection** (2010–2024), 26 Million ~+ sentences were filtered to obtain a subset of migration-related sentences and analyzed their sentiment to track evolving societal attitudes across two languages and over 15 years.
